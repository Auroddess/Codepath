# Scenario D: Student wants to drop the course

Hi Ranchodas,

Thanks for reaching out to us. We understand your situation and, we're sad to see you leave. 

This is to confirm with you that your request to be moved as an observer for **CodePath Android Course** has been processed.

Just some things to know about having an `Observer` role:
1. You have lifetime access to the course material and can study it at their own pace
1. No due dates or any expectations of observers imposed by us.
1. We'll invite you to join our `mailing list` to receive updates on upcoming courses and events

For more information about being an Observer, you may also look into our `Student Manual`.

Congratulations for getting that internship, and best of luck in your new role at Microsoft.


All the best,

CodePath.org Team
