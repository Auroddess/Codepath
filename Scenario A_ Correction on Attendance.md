# **Scenario A**: Correction on Attendance

Hi Raju,


Thanks for reaching out to us.

I'm confirming your attendance last **Saturday, May 22**, in the **CodePath iOS Course** in **CUNY Hunter College**. 

While you may be present during the Saturday session, our Zoom records show that you stayed in the session ***for only 10 minutes***.

As you know, **attendance** is core to our educational model! Our `Course Policy` indicates that failure to attend sessions for at least half of the class duration would correspond to a mark of **Absent** in your records.

To ensure that you will be marked **Present** in future sessions, please make sure ***to register on time or be present for the majority of the class duration***. 

Please be reminded also that we only allow 3 absences, and **on your 4th absence**, you will be ***withdrawn*** from the course.

I hope this helps. Do let us know if you have other concerns regarding your attendance, or any clarifications about our attendance policies.



All the best,

CodePath.org Team
