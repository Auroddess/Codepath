# Scenario B: Withdrawn student is requesting for reconsideration

Hi Pia, 

Thanks for your interest in the **Cybersecurity** course. 

I'm sorry to hear that you've been withdrawn from the course due to incurred absences. It may be a tough decision but perhaps for this semester, it may be best for you to drop the course while you have a full schedule and an overwhelming workload. We appreciate your eagerness to learn as much as you can about Cybersecurity despite your situation, and we'd like to support you in your dream to pursue a career in this field. And yet at the same, we don't want you to be overworked. Likewise, a core element in our courses is attendance for you to fully enjoy and learn from it. 

We're offering the course again next semester and we'd love to have you again in the course when your workload is more manageable. 

And while you may be withdrawn from the class, you will be moved to an `Observer` role. This means that:
1. You have lifetime access to the course material and can study it at your own pace
1. No due dates or any expectations of observers imposed by us.
1. We'll invite you to join our `mailing list` to receive updates on upcoming courses and events

For more information about being an Observer, you may also look into our `Student Manual`.

I hope this helps. Your enthusiasm for learning is very inspiring, and we do hope to see you again next semester!


All the best,

CodePath.org Team
